# Detailed Implementation Plan for Socket.io Chat Application

## Overview
We will build a real-time chat application using React.js (Next.js) and Socket.io that allows users to create/join a room and exchange messages in real time. Messages are kept in memory and vanish on page refresh. The UI will have a modern design using clean typography, spacing, and layout without external icons or image libraries.

## Dependent Files and Required Changes

### 1. Socket.io Server Integration
- **File:** `pages/api/socket.ts`  
  - **Purpose:** Create the Socket.io server endpoint.
  - **Steps:**
    - Import `NextApiRequest` and `NextApiResponse` from Next.js and the `Server` class from `socket.io`.
    - In the request handler, check if `res.socket.server.io` exists to prevent duplicate initialization.
    - If not initialized, create a new Socket.io instance attached to `res.socket.server`.
    - Set up event listeners for:
      - `"connection"` – Log new client connections.
      - `"joinRoom"` – Allow a socket to join a room based on the provided room name.
      - `"chatMessage"` – Receive a message (with room and content) and broadcast it to all clients in that room.
      - `"disconnect"` – Log when a client disconnects.
    - End the response gracefully.

### 2. Chat Application Component
- **File:** `src/components/ChatApp.tsx`  
  - **Purpose:** Create a React component for room selection and chat UI.
  - **Steps:**
    - Import React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`) and `socket.io-client`.
    - Initialize a socket connection using a `useRef` within a `useEffect` block that connects to `/api/socket` and cleans up on unmount.
    - Define component state:
      - `room` (string) – to hold the room name.
      - `joined` (boolean) – to track if the user is in a room.
      - `message` (string) – for the current input.
      - `messages` (array) – to store incoming message objects (each having `sender` and `message` fields).
    - Create a function to handle joining:
      - Validate the room name input.
      - Emit `"joinRoom"` to the server.
      - Set `joined` to `true`.
    - Create a function to handle sending messages:
      - Validate that the message is nonempty.
      - Emit `"chatMessage"` to the server with the room and message.
    - Listen for `"message"` events to update the `messages` state.
    - **UI Elements:**
      - **Room Selection View:** A centered input field and button to join or create a room.
      - **Chat Window View:** 
        - Header showing the room name with modern typography.
        - A scrollable messages container displaying each message with the sender’s id (or placeholder name) and text.
        - A fixed message input area at the bottom with a send button.
    - Implement error handling for empty inputs and connection issues.

### 3. Main Application Page
- **File:** `src/app/page.tsx`  
  - **Purpose:** Serve as the landing page that renders the ChatApp component.
  - **Steps:**
    - Import and render the `<ChatApp />` component.
    - Apply full viewport styling and ensure responsiveness.

### 4. Dependency Management and Styling
- **Dependencies:**
  - Install Socket.io packages by running:
    ```
    npm install socket.io socket.io-client
    ```
- **Styling:**
  - Update `src/app/globals.css` if needed to define a modern, responsive layout.
  - Use CSS for clean spacing, modern typography, responsive form inputs, and error state styling.
  - No external images/icons or libraries are used; the interface relies solely on typography, colors, and layout.

## Summary
- Created `pages/api/socket.ts` to initialize a Socket.io server with robust event management and error checking.
- Developed `src/components/ChatApp.tsx` for room selection and chat functionality with real-time messaging.
- Integrated the ChatApp component into the main page at `src/app/page.tsx` with a full-viewport, modern UI.
- Incorporated error handling, input validation, and cleanup of Socket.io listeners.
- Applied best practices in React functional components, Next.js API routes, and modern CSS styling.
- Dependencies include `socket.io` and `socket.io-client` installed via npm.
